                    We have used SimilarWeb and Website Carbon to create a database of data about different websites.
                    SimilarWeb has provided me with insights into web traffic for these websites, while Website Carbon
                    has helped me estimate the environmental impact of each website in terms of CO2 emissions.<br><br>

                    By using SimilarWeb, we have been able to gather information about the traffic on various websites.
                    I have gained insights into the number of visitors, page views, average time spent on the website,
                    and much more.<br><br>

                    On the other hand, we have used Website Carbon to assess the environmental impact of each website.
                    Using this tool, I have been able to estimate the CO2 emissions for each website based on factors
                    such as server infrastructure, content size, and visit frequency. This has given us a better
                    understanding of how different websites contribute to climate change.<br><br>

                    By combining data from SimilarWeb and Website Carbon, we have been able to compare and evaluate
                    different websites from both traffic and environmental perspectives. We have been able to identify
                    websites with high traffic that also have a low environmental impact, and vice versa. This has
                    helped us gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between website popularity and their
                    environmental footprint.<br><br>
